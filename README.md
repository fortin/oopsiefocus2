# OopsieFocus 2

This script activates the OmniFocus Quick Entry Pane, launching OmniFocus if necessary. Inspired by Shawn Blanc's version, which no longer works with OmniFocus 2 (for me, at least).<sup>\*</sup>

<sup>\*</sup>This documentation is mostly copied from Shawn's original, available [here](http://shawnblanc.net/2011/06/oopsiefocus/), with a couple of minor tweaks.
Works great with Alfred, FastScripts or Keyboard Maestro:

How it works:

- Set this script to run using the same keyboard shortcut that you use to launch the Quick Entry Panel in OmniFocus. 
- If you ever try to activate the Quick Entry Panel but OmniFocus happens to not be running, then this script will launch OmniFocus and bring up the Quick Entry Panel for you.
